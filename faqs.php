        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>The Sqwash has developed a completely custom set of algorithms that we call C.A.C.T.A.S. short for Classifications and Curation Traffic Algorithm Systems. C.A.C.T.A.S enables users to connect with content in a revolutionary way. With CACTAS a user is not limited to one feed. Users have access to 33 unique and diverse feeds, sourced from the entire network. C.A.C.T.A.S sorts media by content or as we call it; classifications, allowing you to surf for specific genres of content.</p>
